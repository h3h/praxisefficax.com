    <h1>About the Principal</h1>
    <figure class="headshot"><img src="img/bradford-headshot-square.jpg" alt="Bradford Fults’s head" width="180" height="180" /></figure>
    <p>
        My name is Bradford Fults and I have over 25 years of experience in
        large-scale B2C and B2B enterprise organizations, in both
        software-native and tech-enabled services businesses, and from the
        smallest teams up to integrated cross-product portfolio delivery teams
        of 1,000&nbsp;people.
    </p>
    <p>
        I bring a sharp eye, effective practices, and proven teaching and change
        management methods to achieve the lasting change you seek in your
        business, all the way to the balance sheet. I am an accomplished leader
        of organizations and technically-minded engineer, able to quickly assess
        both people and systems and then to forecast and integrate the
        capabilities of product &amp; engineering with the rest of
        the&nbsp;business.
    </p>

    <h1>Approach</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I bring a <em>customer-driven</em> mindset to product development
            and engineering (software &amp; hardware), focusing first and
            foremost on how successfully your team is delivering actual results
            to customers that power the engine of the business, in partnership
            with your go-to-market&nbsp;teams.
        </li>
        <li>
            I bring only <em>real-world</em> practices that have been used in
            real businesses to get great results while running on actual
            budgets&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;no big-acronym frameworks or slick slide
            decks without effective methods behind&nbsp;them.
        </li>
        <li>
            I lead with a <em>people-centered</em> approach because the most
            sustainable and effective teams are tightly-knit and trusting teams
            with great leaders and excellent cross-functional relationships. It
            is these teams who will deliver better products, more quickly, and
            who will be more responsive to the needs of your customers and
            the&nbsp;business.
        </li>
    </ul>
